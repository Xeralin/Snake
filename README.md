If you are experiencing issues with your FPS, do not worry. This is a bug in Firefox that is due to the default configuration of Firefox. Just fix it:
1. Enter **about:config** in the address bar and click on *Accept the risk and continue*
2. Enter **layout.frame_rate** above
3. Set the Hz (FPS) value that your monitor supports (-1 is automatic, but unreliable)
